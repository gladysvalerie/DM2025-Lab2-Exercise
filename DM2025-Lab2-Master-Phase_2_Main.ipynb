      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

      "**Data Mining** is the process of discovering patterns, anomalies, correlations, and useful information from large sets of data (often called \"Big Data\"). It's an interdisciplinary field that combines techniques from machine learning, statistics, and database systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal isn't just to see what's in the data, but to extract information that can be used to **predict future outcomes, make better decisions, and understand complex behaviors.**\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Data Mining Process (How It Works)\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining isn't a single step; it's a multi-stage process often referred to as **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Business Understanding:** It starts with a question. What problem are we trying to solve? (e.g., \"Why are customers leaving our service?\" or \"Which products are often bought together?\")\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Gather the relevant data from various sources. Explore it to see what you have.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation (The Most Time-Consuming Step):** This is the \"cleaning\" phase. Raw data is almost always messy. This step involves:\n",
      "    *   **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting errors.\n",
      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from different sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Formatting the data so algorithms can use it (e.g., turning \"Male/Female\" into 1/0).\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** This is where the \"mining\" happens. You apply various algorithms and techniques to the prepared data to find patterns.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Are the patterns you found meaningful and accurate? Do they actually help answer the initial business question? This step validates the model.\n",
      "6.  **Deployment:** The discovered knowledge is put into action. This could be a new marketing strategy, a fraud detection system, or a product recommendation engine on a website.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Common Data Mining Techniques & Tasks\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the most common types of \"gold\" that data miners look for:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Technique | What it Does | Simple Example |\n",
      "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
      "| **Classification** | Sorts items into predefined categories. | An email provider classifying an email as either **\"Spam\"** or **\"Not Spam\"**. |\n",
      "| **Clustering** | Groups similar items together without predefined categories. | A marketing team grouping customers into segments like **\"High-Spenders,\" \"Bargain-Hunters,\"** or **\"New Customers\"** based on their buying habits. |\n",
      "| **Regression** | Predicts a continuous numerical value. | A real estate website predicting a **house's price** based on its size, location, and number of bedrooms. |\n",
      "| **Association Rule Mining** | Finds relationships between items in a dataset. | A supermarket discovering that customers who buy diapers also have a high probability of buying beer (the classic **\"Market Basket Analysis\"**). |\n",
      "| **Anomaly Detection** | Identifies unusual data points that don't fit the normal pattern. | A bank identifying a potentially **fraudulent credit card transaction** because it's much larger than usual and made in a different country. |\n",
      "| **Sequential Pattern Mining** | Discovers patterns that happen in a specific order over time. | An online retailer finding that a customer who buys a smartphone is likely to buy a **case within one week** and **headphones within one month**. |\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Real-World Examples\n",
      "\n",
      "You interact with the results of data mining every day:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Retail & E-commerce:** Amazon's **\"Customers who bought this also bought...\"** and Netflix's **movie recommendations** are classic examples.\n",
      "*   **Finance:** Banks use it for **credit scoring** (predicting if someone will default on a loan) and **fraud detection**.\n",
      "*   **Healthcare:** Predicting which patients are at high risk for certain diseases based on their medical history and lifestyle.\n",
      "*   **Telecommunications:** Identifying customers who are likely to switch to a competitor (known as **\"customer churn\"**).\n",
      "*   **Social Media:** Facebook and Twitter use it to analyze trends, target ads, and suggest connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Takeaway\n",
      "\n",
      "**Data Mining is the bridge between raw data and intelligent action.** It's the science of turning massive amounts of raw information into valuable, predictive insights that can solve business problems and drive strategy.\n"

      "Here are some key aspects to consider when defining Data Mining academically:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Interdisciplinary Field:** Data Mining draws heavily from several disciplines, including:\n",
      "    *   **Statistics:** For understanding data distributions, hypothesis testing, and model evaluation.\n",
      "    *   **Machine Learning:** For developing algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions or classifications.\n",
      "    *   **Database Systems:** For efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of large datasets.\n",
      "    *   **Information Retrieval:** For finding relevant information within unstructured data.\n",
      "    *   **Artificial Intelligence:** For building intelligent systems that can reason and learn.\n",
      "    *   **Visualization:** For presenting discovered patterns in an understandable way.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Goal-Oriented Process:** Data Mining is typically undertaken with a specific objective in mind. This could be:\n",
      "    *   **Prediction:** Forecasting future events or values (e.g., predicting customer churn, stock prices).\n",
      "    *   **Classification:** Assigning data points to predefined categories (e.g., classifying emails as spam or not spam, diagnosing diseases).\n",
      "    *   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without prior knowledge of the groups (e.g., segmenting customers into different market groups).\n",
      "    *   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\").\n",
      "    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual or outlier data points (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",
      "    *   **Summarization:** Providing a concise overview of a dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The KDD Process:** Data Mining is often considered a step within a larger process called **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)**. The KDD process typically involves several stages:\n",
      "    1.  **Selection:** Identifying the relevant data for the task.\n",
      "    2.  **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the data to handle missing values, noise, and inconsistencies. This is a crucial and often time-consuming step.\n",
      "    3.  **Transformation:** Converting data into a format suitable for mining algorithms.\n",
      "    4.  **Data Mining:** Applying algorithms to extract patterns.\n",
      "    5.  **Interpretation/Evaluation:** Assessing the discovered patterns for their validity, usefulness, and understandability.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **\"Mining\" Analogy:** The term \"mining\" is used because it implies extracting valuable resources (knowledge) from a vast and often raw material (data). Just like mining for gold, it requires specialized tools and techniques to uncover hidden treasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Distinction from Data Analysis:** While related, Data Mining is generally more automated and focuses on discovering *unknown* patterns, whereas traditional data analysis might involve more manual exploration and hypothesis testing based on existing knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, Data Mining is a sophisticated, multi-step process that leverages computational techniques to uncover hidden, valuable, and actionable insights from large volumes of data, ultimately leading to better understanding and informed decision-making.**\n",

      "\t Definition \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They are designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. LLMs are characterized by their enormous size (billions or trillions of parameters) and their ability to perform a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Capabilities \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs can perform tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, code generation, and creative writing. They learn complex linguistic patterns, grammar, facts, and reasoning abilities from their training data. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Underlying Technology \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are typically built using deep learning architectures, most notably the Transformer architecture, which allows them to process sequential data like text very effectively. \n",

      "Relationship Between Machine Learning, Data Centers, and LLMs \n",
      "\n",
      "\t LLMs as a Product of Machine Learning \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t LLMs are a sophisticated application and outcome of machine learning research and development. The techniques used to train LLMs, such as deep learning and neural networks, are core machine learning concepts. Therefore, LLMs are a specific, advanced type of machine learning model. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Data Centers as the Foundation for LLMs and ML \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t Interdependence \n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t In essence, machine learning is the field of study and the set of techniques. LLMs are a powerful manifestation of these techniques. Data centers are the physical environments and infrastructure that enable the training, deployment, and operation of both general machine learning models and highly demanding LLMs. LLMs rely on ML principles, and both ML and LLMs rely heavily on the resources provided by data centers. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

      "Fight Club – jackdurden.com Analysis: \n",
      "Summary \n",
      "🎯 Core Thesis \n",
      "●​ The film version of Fight Club should be interpreted as its own standalone work — not as \n",
      "an adaptation tied strictly to the novel.​\n",
      " \n",
      "●​ According to jackdurden.com, many major characters in the film — including Marla \n",
      "Singer, Tyler Durden, and other side characters — are not “real.” Rather, they’re \n",
      "psychological projections or alternate personalities of the narrator (often referred to as \n",
      "“Jack” in the script).​\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "🔍 Key “Rules” / Evidence & Interpretation \n",
      "Rule #1: Marla Singer is Not Real \n",
      "●​ Marla and Tyler share remarkably similar clothing, accessories, posture, even smoking \n",
      "habits — suggesting they represent facets of the same psyche rather than distinct \n",
      "individuals.​\n",
      " \n",
      "●​ In one hotel-scene with a convex mirror, Marla (or Tyler) has no reflection — an \n",
      "indication (according to the site) that they don’t “exist” independently.​\n",
      " \n",
      "●​ The “laundromat” scene: Marla removes men’s jeans from dryers, then later appears \n",
      "wearing a feminine dress (which she says she got at a thrift store). The site reads this as \n",
      "symbolic: the narrator shedding his masculinity and “becoming” Marla.​\n",
      " \n",
      "Rule #2: Other Characters Also “Not Real” \n",
      "●​ Figures such as Bob Paulson, Raymond K. Hessel, members of the underground group \n",
      "(e.g. “Project Mayhem”), even a support-group woman named Chloe — are also treated \n",
      "as mental constructs, not objective beings.​\n",
      "\"\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Page 2**\n",
      "\"\"\"\n",
      "●​ The “house” used by Tyler and the group (the “Paper Street House”) is argued to never \n",
      "physically exist — instead it is a “psychological space,” a metaphor for the narrator’s \n",
      "mental breakdown.​\n",
      " \n",
      "On Book vs Film: Differences Are Intentional \n",
      "●​ The site emphasizes that comparing the film to the novel misses the point. The film is a \n",
      "deliberate re-interpretation, a new artistic work. Critiques based on the book are \n",
      "dismissed as irrelevant. ​\n",
      " \n",
      "Addressing Common Counter-Arguments \n",
      "●​ When people argue “others interact with Marla/Tyler, so they must be real,” the site \n",
      "counters: those interactions can still be projections of the narrator’s fractured psyche. \n",
      "Even shared scenes can be hallucinated — so nothing objective needs to be “real.”​\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "🧠 Overall Conclusion (per jackdurden.com) \n",
      "What we watch in Fight Club — from relationships, group membership, underground activism, to \n",
      "interpersonal conflicts — isn’t necessarily external or objective. Instead, the film (as interpreted) \n",
      "maps a descent into disordered identity: the narrator is trapped in inner turmoil, projecting \n",
      "multiple personas (Marla, Tyler, Bob, etc.) to cope with his existential and psychological crises. \n",
      "In that light, “everything” is internal: a metaphorical psychodrama.  \n",
      " \n",
      "🧾 Context in Broader Interpretation of Fight Club \n",
      "While jackdurden.com’s interpretation is extreme (arguing nearly all characters are \n",
      "hallucinations), it fits into a broader wave of readings of Fight Club that view the film as a \n",
      "critique of modern alienation, consumerism, and fractured masculinity. Scholars have argued \n",
      "the film uses violence, degradation, and disorientation to illustrate psychological and societal \n",
      "breakdown.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nFight Club – jackdurden.com Analysis: \\nSummary \\n🎯 Core Thesis \\n●\\u200b The film version of Fight Club should be interpreted as its own standalone work — not as \\nan adaptation tied strictly to the novel.\\u200b\\n \\n●\\u200b According to jackdurden.com, many major characters in the film — including Marla \\nSinger, Tyler Durden, and other side characters — are not “real.” Rather, they’re \\npsychological projections or alternate personalities of the narrator (often referred to as \\n“Jack” in the script).\\u200b\\n \\n \\n🔍 Key “Rules” / Evidence & Interpretation \\nRule #1: Marla Singer is Not Real \\n●\\u200b Marla and Tyler share remarkably similar clothing, accessories, posture, even smoking \\nhabits — suggesting they represent facets of the same psyche rather than distinct \\nindividuals.\\u200b\\n \\n●\\u200b In one hotel-scene with a convex mirror, Marla (or Tyler) has no reflection — an \\nindication (according to the site) that they don’t “exist” independently.\\u200b\\n \\n●\\u200b The “laundromat” scene: Marla removes men’s jeans from dryers, then later appears \\nwearing a feminine dress (which she says she got at a thrift store). The site reads this as \\nsymbolic: the narrator shedding his masculinity and “becoming” Marla.\\u200b\\n \\nRule #2: Other Characters Also “Not Real” \\n●\\u200b Figures such as Bob Paulson, Raymond K. Hessel, members of the underground group \\n(e.g. “Project Mayhem”), even a support-group woman named Chloe — are also treated \\nas mental constructs, not objective beings.\\u200b\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\"\"\"\\n●\\u200b The “house” used by Tyler and the group (the “Paper Street House”) is argued to never \\nphysically exist — instead it is a “psychological space,” a metaphor for the narrator’s \\nmental breakdown.\\u200b\\n \\nOn Book vs Film: Differences Are Intentional \\n●\\u200b The site emphasizes that comparing the film to the novel misses the point. The film is a \\ndeliberate re-interpretation, a new artistic work. Critiques based on the book are \\ndismissed as irrelevant. \\u200b\\n \\nAddressing Common Counter-Arguments \\n●\\u200b When people argue “others interact with Marla/Tyler, so they must be real,” the site \\ncounters: those interactions can still be projections of the narrator’s fractured psyche. \\nEven shared scenes can be hallucinated — so nothing objective needs to be “real.”\\u200b\\n \\n \\n🧠 Overall Conclusion (per jackdurden.com) \\nWhat we watch in Fight Club — from relationships, group membership, underground activism, to \\ninterpersonal conflicts — isn’t necessarily external or objective. Instead, the film (as interpreted) \\nmaps a descent into disordered identity: the narrator is trapped in inner turmoil, projecting \\nmultiple personas (Marla, Tyler, Bob, etc.) to cope with his existential and psychological crises. \\nIn that light, “everything” is internal: a metaphorical psychodrama.  \\n \\n🧾 Context in Broader Interpretation of Fight Club \\nWhile jackdurden.com’s interpretation is extreme (arguing nearly all characters are \\nhallucinations), it fits into a broader wave of readings of Fight Club that view the film as a \\ncritique of modern alienation, consumerism, and fractured masculinity. Scholars have argued \\nthe film uses violence, degradation, and disorientation to illustrate psychological and societal \\nbreakdown.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
