It lists two main categories: Structured Data Sets and Unstructured Data Sets. Structured data is described as a collection of data organized in certain formats, often in rows and columns, with a clear, predictable structure. Unstructured data is described as more complex and varied, usually derived from human-generated content like text, images, and videos.\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 110:58]\nSo the next one we want to talking about the data set. We have different type of data set. You might heard about the term called structured data or unstructured data. Structured data is you know exactly the meaning about the row and column. Unstructured data is they will change. Sometimes you don't really know how to interpret them. Currently that the human generate content such as image, text, video, we consider them as unstructured data.\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 111:36]\nLuckily with this AI thing and right now text, image, video already can be converting into structured format, but you still need to be able to know once we convert, are they meaningful or not.\n\n[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]\nThe slide is titled \"Characteristics of Data Sets\". It lists three characteristics: Dimensionality (Curse of Dimensionality), Sparsity (Only presence counts), and Resolution (Patterns depend on the scale). A speech bubble says \"Later\" next to Sparsity.\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 111:53]\nSo we have different kind of characteristic about our data dimension we mentioned before. Sparsity comes from a key word called sparse. Sparse means very few. Like what we say that if you have the record in e-commerce store, like in Amazon. Your data is sparse in that data record. Because they have millions of the record, but then you probably only buy 10 books before. So make your data in the millions then become very sparse. So data are sparse. And sometimes in certain place, we will also talking about the resolution. And that part about sparsity, how to solving them, how to do the resolution, we will talking about later in some of the courses, some of them will be in classification, some of them will be in the text mining.\n\n[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]\nThe slide is titled \"Types of Data Sets\". It lists three types: Data Matrix, Document Data, and Transaction Data.\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 112:58]\nWe want to talk about different type of the data set. We have the data matrix, document data, transaction data. So data matrix look like this way. If each object has the same fixed set of numeric attributes. Okay, they can become data metric. And then we allow them to do the ratio operation. All the value inside need to become the ratio data. So then right here, they need to be ratio data.\n\n[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]\nThe slide is titled \"Data Matrix\". It states: \"If each object has the same fixed set of numeric attributes\". A table shows \"Book 1\" to \"Book 5\" with columns for \"Price\", \"Sells\", \"# Reviews\", and \"# Readers\". The values are numeric.\n\n[TRANSCRIPT - 114:48]\nOkay. And the document data is a part that we were talking about later because before 2013, this is before 2013. Okay. And the people actually utilize document data in a vector form. Right here. So they select important keyword in the document. And then after that, for every document, you utilize those important keyword, we got some number, occurrence of the number for that keyword right there. We generate a something called term vector. So each one of them are vector. Why vector? Because in computer science, vector is the way for us to operate. We convert them to vector, so in other word, every number right here are become ratio data. But that is way we try to work in that before 2013. After 2013, how we try to do that? We will talking about that in the text mining part. So maybe three weeks later.\n", "document_id": "doc_79be0e7a"}
