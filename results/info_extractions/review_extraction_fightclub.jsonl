The site reads this as \nsymbolic: the narrator shedding his masculinity and “becoming” Marla.​\n \nRule #2: Other Characters Also “Not Real” \n●​ Figures such as Bob Paulson, Raymond K. Hessel, members of the underground group \n(e.g. “Project Mayhem”), even a support-group woman named Chloe — are also treated \nas mental constructs, not objective beings.​\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\n●​ The “house” used by Tyler and the group (the “Paper Street House”) is argued to never \nphysically exist — instead it is a “psychological space,” a metaphor for the narrator’s \nmental breakdown.​\n \nOn Book vs Film: Differences Are Intentional \n●​ The site emphasizes that comparing the film to the novel misses the point. The film is a \ndeliberate re-interpretation, a new artistic work. Critiques based on the book are \ndismissed as irrelevant. ​\n \nAddressing Common Counter-Arguments \n●​ When people argue “others interact with Marla/Tyler, so they must be real,” the site \ncounters: those interactions can still be projections of the narrator’s fractured psyche. \nEven shared scenes can be hallucinated — so nothing objective needs to be “real.”​\n \n \n🧠 Overall Conclusion (per jackdurden.com) \nWhat we watch in Fight Club — from relationships, group membership, underground activism, to \ninterpersonal conflicts — isn’t necessarily external or objective. Instead, the film (as interpreted) \nmaps a descent into disordered identity: the narrator is trapped in inner turmoil, projecting \nmultiple personas (Marla, Tyler, Bob, etc.) to cope with his existential and psychological crises. \nIn that light, “everything” is internal: a metaphorical psychodrama.  \n \n🧾 Context in Broader Interpretation of Fight Club \nWhile jackdurden.com’s interpretation is extreme (arguing nearly all characters are \nhallucinations), it fits into a broader wave of readings of Fight Club that view the film as a \ncritique of modern alienation, consumerism, and fractured masculinity. Scholars have argued \nthe film uses violence, degradation, and disorientation to illustrate psychological and societal \nbreakdown.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_4a65bf5a"}
